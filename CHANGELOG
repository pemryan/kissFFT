1.0
    changed kiss_fft function from using a single buffer, to two buffers.
    If the same buffer pointer is supplied for both in and out, kiss will
    manage the buffer copies.

    added kiss_fft2d and kiss_fftr as separate source files (declarations in kiss_fft.h )

0.4 : optimized for radix 2,3,4,5

0.3 : woops, version 2 didn't actually factor out any radices other than 2

0.2 : added mixed radix, only radix 2,4 optimized versions

0.1 :  initial release, radix 2 only
